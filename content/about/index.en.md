description: " If you enjoy technology and are a professional or a tech enthusiast, you have come to the right place. 
This blog is about hardware, software, and everything that those two bring together and keep in the middle. 
The social aspect is important because, after all, we are humans...still. 
As a result, the author of this blog has a special affinity for free and open source ideas. 
He believes that freedom of expression and the right to privacy are the most important human rights. 
However, he understands the time-in-coordination system of confusion and has a professional respect for all technological innovations, forÂ which he believes everything has a place and a purpose. 
He believes that community activism has an impact and can lead to a better future for society. "
