There are many reasons why you may need to capture the screen on your computer. 
And you've come to the right place if you're using the **Windows 10** operating system. 
Because you'll learn how to accomplish it in more than one method in this post. 
What's more, you don't even need a third-party program because everything you need is already built into your operating system.

In Windows 10, you have more ways of taking a screenshot.
* [Using the **Print Screen (PrtScr)** Key.](#take-a-screenshot-using-print-screen-prtscr) 
* [Using the **Snipping Tool**.](#take-a-screenshot-using-snipping-tool) 
* [Using **Snip & Sketch Tool**.](#take-a-screenshot-using-snip--sktech-tool)
* [And finally usng the **Xbox game bar**.](#take-a-screenshot-using-xbox-game-bar)

Let's see how to do it with each of these methods.

<br>

## Take a Screenshot Using Print Screen (PrtScr)

<br>

The whole screen is copied to the Clipboard when you hit the **Print Screen** <kbd>PrtScr</kbd> key. 
When you combining <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>PrtScr</kbd> just copies the active window to Clipboard.

You will also need to use other software, such as Photoshop, Gimp, Paint, or Paint 3D, to complete this procedure, because the image is copied to the clipboard and you will need to paste it into some of the apps. 
When you use the <kbd>❖ Windows</kbd> + <kbd>PrtScr</kbd>, the screenshot is saved straight in the screenshots folder in the pictures. And he's going to capture the entire screen. 


<br>

## Take a Screenshot Using Snipping Tool

<br>

To use the sniping tool, hit the <kbd>❖ Windows</kbd> key, then type the **Snipping Tool** in the search box. This will launch the tool.

There are several screen capture options available with this tool. So you can capture the screen in free form, which means you can draw a shape that will be captured when you ask for it. It has the ability to capture the entire screen or just the active window. After you launch the tool, all you have to do is follow the simple options it offers. This tool, however, is moving to a new app named "Snip & Sketch." 
And that's exactly what we'll go over in the next section of this post.


<br>

## Take a Screenshot Using Snip & Sktech Tool

<br>

The Snip & Sketch tool is quite similar to the Snipping Tool, with nearly identical features. The only difference between them is the look of the tool itself. Start this tool by hitting the <kbd>❖ Windows</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> key on the keyboard, and in the upper half of the screen, you'll see a rectangle with options for how you want to capture your screen.
When you select how you want to capture the screen, click mouse anywhere in the window or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and the screenshot will be saved in a clipboard so you can past it in some other app or you can open in the app itself and use some of the other options available.

## Take a Screenshot Using Xbox Game Bar

<br>

The Xbox game bar has multiple purposes and is primarily intended for recording and tracking the performance of the PC while playing games. 
It can also record video games or active screens, but also has a screen capture option. 
By pressing the <kbd>❖ Windows</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> key open the Xbox game bar, when the app appears, you'll see an icon that looks like a camera. Click it, and the screen will be captured. The Screenshot will be saved in the captures folder located in the videos.
You can also use shortcut <kbd>❖ Windows</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> + <kbd>PrtScr</kbd>, which will directly capture the screen and Screenshot will save in the folder screenshots contained in the pictures.
