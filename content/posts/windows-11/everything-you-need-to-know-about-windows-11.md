When Microsoft released Windows 10 in 2015, he stated that it would be the final version of Windows. So, in essence, all new functionality will be gained through Windows updates. It was a headache, and many people disliked them for good reason. They destroy systems, delete data, and sometimes just appear at the wrong moment when you are in the middle of something. Microsoft eventually improved them, although there were still some issues. But, no matter how irritating the updates are, they are required, and it is critical to keep your system up to date.
Then, in the middle of the year, there came word that a new version of Windows 11 was on the way.
And now he's here.
On October 5th, the official release date was announced.

## What is new in Windows 11?

<br/>

If there's one thing in Windows 11 that sticks out, it's this: The start menu and taskbar are now centered at the bottom of the screen, rather than being positioned to the left by default. Yes, the single most significant visual and interface difference will be evident on the first day. Sure, there's a lot more going on behind the surface, but this UI change feels like it's more to let you know that something new and different is happening.
There's a lot going on with Windows 11. If you're a casual or mainstream user, you're unlikely to notice much of a difference, but there are a few key enhancements worth highlighting.

<br/>
<br/>

### New features

<br/>

Let's see what the new features of Windows 11 are, except for the start menu and task bar.

<br/>
<br/>

### New Context Menu & Rounded Corners

<br/>

The contest menu finally looks modern and follows the whole Windows 11 round corner aesthetics, which look nice.
Now, rounded corners are everywhere.
Some would say that this, together with the centralization of the start menu, remains on Apple Mac OSX, but it looks nice and Microsoft should proceed in that direction.

<br/>
<br/>

### New Action Center

<br/>

The Action Center in Windows 11 differs significantly from the Action Center in Windows 10. It uses a new "panels" style in which your alerts and controls are organized into groups, with notifications appearing above the Quick Settings panel.
The Action Center is now resizable and flexible, and it still has a "Clear all" button in the upper right corner.
The overall operation of the Windows 11 Action Center stays the same, but the quick settings panel is now more customizable.

<br/>
<br/>

### New file explorer

<br/>

There are no tabs in the new File Explorer, but there are many other improvements, such as a new modern interface, icons, a revamped context menu, and many more adjustments.
The UI in this new version has rounded edges and a foundation layer that uses the Mica material, which allows the backdrop Â shine through the app without affecting performance or battery life and goes back to a solid color when the program is not in focus. The menu and title bar have now been merged into a single header interface.

<br/>
<br/>

### Android apps are now supported on Windows 11

<br/>

Installing apps is a simple procedure. Because Microsoft has partnered with Amazon, the Microsoft Store will list applications but will link you to the Amazon Appstore app to install or update them. This also installs a Windows Subsystem for Android in the background, which is the core technology that allows Android apps to operate on Windows 11.
Apps run in a virtual machine, where they are separated within their own environment but may coexist with other Windows apps. Android applications may be pinned to the Start menu or taskbar and use all of Windows 11's windowing and multitasking features, just like any other desktop software.

<br/>
<br/>

### Snap Layout

<br/>

Snap Layouts, a new feature in Windows 11, allows you to combine programs and windows together to better manage them. It's similar to how you can group applications on Android and iOS, or how you can use Split Screen.
Assume you're planning something and have a number of applications or webpages open that are all connected to your search. With Snap Layouts, you can keep all the information on your screen neatly arranged. To utilize it, hover your cursor over a window's maximize button, pick a layout, then click on a zone in that layout to snap that window into place; choosing additional windows individually places them in different zones in that layout. For example, you might group open windows together.

<br/>
<br/>

### These are just a few of the new features. Windows 11 also includes these new features:

<br/>

- New store

- Universal Media Control

- The redesigned Settings App

- Quicker Windows Updates

- Widgets

- Team Chat Integration

- Your Mobile App

- MS Paint, Photos, MS Office, Media Player

- Focus Sessions

- Typing by voice

- Advanced Gesture Controls

- Screen Lock

- Wallpapers and sounds

- Snappy Animations

- Improvements to the touch keyboard

- Auto HDR and Dynamic Refresh Rate

- Syncing the Clipboard

- Screen Time and Battery Usage

- ARM Emulation

<br/>
<br/>

## Should you upgrade?

<br/>

Overall, the new Windows 11 operating system is a fantastic operating system with several aesthetic and performance enhancements.
And if you have new hardware and enjoy being on the cutting edge of new software, you should certainly go ahead and update.
However, at the time of writing, Windows 11 has issues with AMD chips, and computers with AMD processors suffer slowdowns and poor performance when compared to PCs with Intel processors.
As a result, just like with other windows versions, it is safest to wait a bit longer until the majority of issues are resolved.
