When Zuckerberg started Facebook in the dorms of Harvard, he was a computer science student who was very interested in social issues like privacy and social movements.  
He and his friends used it to keep track of one another, but within a few years it became a tool of mass consumerism and media manipulation, and it attracted the attention of the political and media establishment.  
The result is the social network we all know today, which now serves to create and distribute images of and about what people want to be.  
Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg once said, “We are in the business of capturing and distributing human attention.”

Facebook (FB) will be renamed as Meta on December 1, 2022. (MVRS). The name change was announced during the Facebook Connect Augmented and Virtual Reality Conference.
The names of the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp apps will not change.
