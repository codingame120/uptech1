## What Exactly Are Yubikeys, And How Do You Use Them?

<br/>

Yubico is a brand of security keys that provide physical two-factor authentication.

The YubiKey is a hardware two-factor authentication device. The YubiKey is intended to ensure that the owner of the device, not the device, is the one that logs into the account. Each key is unique and can be used to access your online accounts as well as secure sensitive data.

## What is Two-Factor Authentication?

<br/>

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security technique that involves using two factors to verify a person’s identity. A second factor is something different from an account credential, such as a telephone number, a hardware token, or a code sent to a mobile device. For example, a service might require a second factor, such as a username and password, as well as a secret question or code sent to a mobile device. The second factor can be something the user has (a device or token) or something the user knows (a code sent to a mobile device).

## Why To Use Yubikey?

YubiKey is a better solution because it's less likely to be compromised. So it is the safer option. To access the app, you need to plug in the YubiKey and press the button to authenticate. Because you don't have to type, cod is one more step in security. The codes themselves are longer.

Besides being safer, the YubiKey is also really easy to use. Even if you migrate from another computer, you just plug in the YubiKey and you can access apps the same as before. Simple.

You can use YubiKey to log in to your computer or laptop system. So it is very useful.
