            </div>What Is Metasploit  Metasploit is a free, open-source penetration testing framework. It is designed for use against a single computer or network, in contrast to other penetration testing tools such as nikto and cain and abel that target a network of computers. This is done to reduce the time spent in scanning for a network, increasing the speed at which exploits can be found.
The metasploit framework contains pre-configured plugins and exploits, although the user can also write their own.]]></description>
