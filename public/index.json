Well unfortunately not very much! Due to various functions enabled in Google Chrome, Safari and other major Web Browsers it leads to lack of security. Some can be modified in settings, but to most of them we as end users do not have access, they are built in the core of the Browsers.

So you need to know the characteristics of the browser to be able to know what you can do, expect, and for what use it. Thus, we will list the characteristics of each browser, pros and cons. And for what is more suitable. But security as well as privacy does not depend on just one application. For that, it is important how much the device is fully secured. And how we behave ourselves.
