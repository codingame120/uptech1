# Top 8 Web Browsers for Android and IOS That Are Most Secure And Private


## Introduction

Great amount of time on our phones we spend searching the web, how safe are our default browsers in terms of malware and virus protection and how much they respect our privacy? Well unfortunately not very much!
Due to various functions enabled in Google Chrome, Safari and other major Web Browsers it leads to lack of security. Some can be modified in settings, but to most of them we as end users do not have access, they are built in the core of the Browsers.
And even with add-ons (extensions) we can not do much to increase our security.

Unfortunately, it is only in terms of security. There is also the problem of privacy, which the biggest threat are exactly those main players. Who collect our data and sell it for marketing purposes.

> That is where the saying goes: <cite>“If Something Is Free, the Product Is You”</cite>

So the question arises, can we do something and do we need to do something about it?
Fortunately, the answer is yes and yes. We can do something about it, and we need to do something about it.
There are web browsers that are free open source, and they are a better option for both our security and our privacy.

In terms of privacy, you should change the search engine to DuckDuckGo.
On any browser is a more privacy accepted option. Because DuckDuckGo do not save your logs do not track you and do not mine your data and pack them in profile to sold in marketing purpose as google do.

Privacy and security should be seen as two separate things, because they are. So some browsers will be better in terms of privacy and others in terms of security. So you need to know the characteristics of the browser to be able to know what you can do, expect, and for what use it.

Thus, we will list the characteristics of each browser, pros and cons. And for what is more suitable.
But security as well as privacy does not depend on just one application. For that, it is important how much the device is fully secured. And how we behave ourselves. It is good to use several browsers, one for optional daily internet surfing and other that can connect with our identity. Do not mix those two profiles.

Here is a list of the best web browsers in terms of security and safety for your phone:

### Tor {#tor}

![Tor Browser Photo](/posts/bes-web-browsers-phone/img/tor-post-min.jpg "Tor Browser")

Tor is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication by directing Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than seven thousand relays in order to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis.

Tor is an absolute winner in terms of security and privacy, on this list.
But is it bulletproof? NOT! Nothing is. And it's important to know how to properly use tor and how to behave on the web to achieve the highest level of security and privacy.

Unfortunately Tor is not available for iOS smart devices, but have official substitution Onion Browser about which we will write in further text. To use Tor on Android devices you will need and an app called Orbot, developed from same organization Guardian Project.

Orbot is a free proxy server for Android system build to provide anonymity.  
It is used to keep the communications of users anonymized and hidden from governments and third parties that might be monitoring their internet traffic.

And it is highly recommended to use Tor together with Orbot.  
Orbot is also best VPN for android, and it's completely free.
But it functions different from classical VPN. It is best to not change a lot of Tor default settings and not to tweak except if you don't know what are you doing.

Tor comes with max security and privacy out of box, but still have something that you can change a some Add-ons that you can add to achieve a higher level of security and privacy.  
Recommended are **_HTTPS Everywhere_** and **_NoSCript_**.

Lets see what we can do:

- #### Set Security Level (Recommended)

  Go to **_Settings>>Set your Security Level_** and set to safest. It is the best for most cases. If some site that you want to see is broken you can set it to safer, but it's good to back it to safest when you finish visits to that site.

  ![Tor Browser Settings Photo](/posts/bes-web-browsers-phone/img/t1-min.jpg "Tor Browser Settings Photo")

- #### Turn Off Autocomplete and Search Suggestions(Recommended)

  Go to **_Settings>>Privacy and Security_** and toggle off all options.
