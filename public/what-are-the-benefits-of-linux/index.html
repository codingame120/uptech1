<h2 id="what-exactly-is-linux">What Exactly is Linux?</h2>
<p><strong>Linux</strong> is a UNIX-like operating system which is completely free, open source and community supported.<br>
<strong>Linux</strong> is the most popular open source operating system that is the foundation of most of the Internet.<br>
<strong>Linux</strong> powers most of the web.<br>
<strong>Linux</strong> powers the servers that provide the infrastructure to the entire Internet.<br>
<strong>Linux</strong> powers the mobile phones and tablets.</p>
<p>The linux operating system was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.</p>
<p>Unlike the Windows Operating System which was created by Bill Gates, the Linux Operating System is free to anyone who wants it and open source which means that anyone in the world can modify the code, and develop apps for it.</p>
<p>The Linux OS is free and open source because it can be downloaded, compiled, and installed by anyone.
The Linux OS can run on many different hardware and the hardware manufacturers are making it easier for anyone to install the OS on their computer.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-using-linux">Benefits of Using Linux</h2>
<p>The benefits of using linux are many, but one of the main benefits is that you can run your own software on your own operating system.</p>
<p>Linux is the most frequently used operating system in the world (Android and Most of the Web Servers).</p>
<p>Many companies offer products that can run on Linux, including Google, eBay, Amazon, Mozilla etc.</p>
<p>Many organizations, such as schools, colleges, and universities, use Linux. With its open source infrastructure, Linux is often used to store, manage, and use the data from scientific experiments, which is usually in the form of numbers. The ability to store, manage, and share data allows scientists to perform and analyze their experiments more quickly and effectively, which is another benefit of using linux. The open source nature of Linux also supports its widespread use in scientific experiments.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="the-benefits-of-linux-include">The benefits of Linux include:</h3>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>A cost effective alternative to traditional operating systems.</li>
<li>The ability to customize the system for your specific needs and requirements.</li>
<li>Open source software is available at no charge, which means you can modify or add
new functions without paying a licensing fee.</li>
<li>The ability to access a wide variety of software applications for free.</li>
<li>Free technical support is available from the community.</li>
<li>You can run multiple operating systems simultaneously on the same computer.</li>
<li>The ability to change hardware components without voiding your warranty.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The benefits of Linux are not limited to users who want a cost effective alternative to traditional operating systems, but also include those who want the flexibility and power of an open source OS, or simply prefer it because it is free.</p>
<p>Because there are no licensing fees associated with Linux, you have complete freedom over what software you install on your system—including proprietary software.</p>
<p>Linux can be used on a variety of hardware platforms.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel is the core component of the operating system and provides a large number of services to other components.
The Linux kernel is open-source software for which development is managed by the Linux Kernel Community Collaborative Project (LKCP).
LKCP was founded in 1997 as an effort to create a community project that would maintain and develop the Linux kernel.
In 2005, Linus Torvalds announced that he would not be taking a role in the kernel development.
In 2007, Torvalds said that he had been &ldquo;misunderstood&rdquo; and that his decision was based on a desire to have more time for other projects.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="what-is-linux-kernel">What Is Linux Kernel?</h2>
<br/>
<p>The Linux kernel is developed by volunteers from all over the world who contribute
their expertise and time.
The LKCP has a core group of developers who are responsible for maintaining the Linux kernel&rsquo;s source code, but there is no single person or organization with the power to veto changes.</p>
<p>The kernel is the heart of your Linux system, and it&rsquo;s responsible for deciding what happens when you try to do things like close a file or turn off your computer.
The kernel also decides which applications can be run on the system by checking for certain characteristics in each application before allowing it to be loaded into memory.
You can think of the kernel as an operating system that runs directly on top of hardware instead of being sandboxed by a separate OS layer such as Windows or Mac OS.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel is made up of many different components, like device drivers and
system calls. These are the building blocks that make your computer work in a
consistent manner across all hardware configurations.
The core of the Linux kernel is written in C; however, there are other programming languages used to write applications for the kernel such as C++ and assembly language (also called machine code or &ldquo;machine code&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Linux kernel is to provide an operating system abstraction
layer that provides a consistent interface to the hardware. This means that each piece of hardware has its own driver, but it also means that applications written for Linux</p>
<p>The Linux kernel is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is free software . The GPL allows anyone to use, modify or distribute the kernel as long as they make their modifications available to others through redistribution.
However, there are some restrictions on how you can redistribute the kernel.
For example, you cannot redistribute a modified kernel in binary form without also distributing your modifications in source form along with it.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel is the most widely used open-source operating system and has been
for many years now. It is developed by thousands of developers who contribute to its development on an ongoing basis, which ensures that it will continue to be
maintained and supported for many years to come.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="there-are-many-distribution-of-linux">There are Many Distribution of Linux</h2>
<br/>
<p>The distribution of Linux is as varied as the number of people who use it. There are several hundred Linux distributions, most of which are based on the Unix system.</p>
<p>The following is a list of some popular ones:</p>
<p><strong>Red Hat (RH)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Red Hat’s flagship product is RHEL, an enterprise-level distribution of Linux.<br>
RHEL is available in three versions, Standard (the most popular), Enterprise Server, and Advanced Server.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CentOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CentOS is a community-driven distribution of the Linux operating system that was started by Red Hat and now has become quite popular with the open source
community.<br>
CentOS is available in three versions, Enterprise Server (the most
popular), Advanced Server and Workstation.<br>
<a href="https://www.centos.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><em>Download CentOS</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu is a Debian-based distribution of Linux that uses GNOME as its default desktop environment.<br>
It has a large community of users and developers. Ubuntu’s most popular versions are the desktop-oriented Kubuntu, the server-oriented Xubuntu, and the minimalistic phone-based Ubuntugnome.<br>
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><em>Download Ubuntu</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux Mint</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Linux Mint is community-supported free Linux distribution aimed at new Linux users. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu but provides a simple, intuitive graphical interface and uses the traditional Mint-branded desktop environment.
The interface is suitable for users who are used to working in a Windows environment.<br>
<a href="https://linuxmint.com/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><em>Download Linux Mint</em></a></p>
<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other distributions of Linux.</p>
<p>There are Fedora, Slackware, Mandriva, Scientific Linux, Mandriva+, Mandriva++, etc. Some of the more well known distributions of Linux are: Fedora, Ubuntu, Suse, Mint etc.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="why-so-many-distroes">Why So Many Distroes</h2>
<br/>
<p>There are several reasons why we use different Linux distributions besides the fact that we have a choice.</p>
<p>The main reason is that not all distributions have the same base software, and some distributions have more software packages than others.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that there are more and more Linux distros that have more and more software packages.</p>
<p>Many distros have a lot of the same software packages, but they are often put together in different ways, making them look different.</p>
<p>Some of the distributions have different philosophies, and some of them are just different because they are different.</p>
<p>There are distributions that come with a lot of software already installed, and some distributions are better for beginner Linux users, and some Linux distributions are more &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; for advanced users.</p>
<p>For example, the Mandriva distribution is designed for the advanced Linux user, and it has many more software packages than other distributions.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<br/>
<p>The most important thing is that the Linux distros are different.</p>
<p>They have different packages, different interfaces, and different ways of doing things.
Some distros are really easy and some are really difficult, but most distros are somewhere in the middle.
Some distros are more like a car where you can change parts, but there is a lot of overlap among different options.</p>
